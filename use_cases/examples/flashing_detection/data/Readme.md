# Ingest the sample data

In this section, you explore the contents of the repository's data and load sample data generated by the python script to BigQuery.

In the Cloud Shell Editor instance, navigate to the data folder in the repository:

### cd ../../../use_cases/examples/flashing_detection/data/

This folder contains two subfolders which are *generation* and *schema*.

Inspect the contents of the *generation* folder, it has a datagen.py script, which needs to be executed to generate sample data that will be ingested to the bigquery tables.

#### Placeholder for GTS to provide more information on the data generation script
