# BoE Transforming the Data Collection - CRE report demo from Google

This project is a worked example on how the data collection could be transformed for the CRE report.

# BACKGROUND

## Purpose and key points

The Bank of England is undertaking an underwriting standards review of international banks' lending into the UK
Commercial Real Estate (CRE) market. Banks should fill in this template with the relevant information on their stock of
UK CRE loans at the Group level, regardless of where in the group the loan has been booked. This should include the
refinancing of facilities due to expire or being offered to competitors by borrowers for finance, for both existing and
new borrowers.

## Coverage

The review will cover business units managing existing CRE loans (and, if relevant, units using new loans)

## Data Point

The review will cover international banks' stock of UK CRE loans at the Group level (tab "Loan-level data - stock"),
regardless of where in the group the loan has been booked. The review also requests loan-level data on 2020 UK CRE loan
flows, if more than £300 million of CRE loans originated in 2020 have been or are expected to be distributed out.

## Scope

The scope for this CRE loan-level data collection is the following: commercial real estate investment and development
loans secured against property located in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland only.

For the avoidance of doubt, no personal data is requested, nor should be provided, as part of this information request.

The scope of the CRE loan data collection includes:

* House builders with non-recourse SPV exposure for a specific property development
* Hotels and nursing homes on a third party lease * Specific developments or structured exposures for corporate property
  companies (eg British Land plc)

The following categories are excluded from this CRE data collection:

* Retail buy-to-let exposures
* Trading exposures to house builders (banking book exposures are included)
* Other nursing home and hotel loans (ie owner occupied)
* Op Co/Prop Co exposures within a wider corporate relationship
* Hedging positions where there is no debt
* Loans extended under lifetime mortgages
* Bonds, corporate debt and publicly traded debt or securities

# INSTRUCTIONS

## Tab #3 - Loan-level data - stock

In the tab ""Loan-level data - stock"", we ask for the following tables to be filled in:

* Table A (in cells B4-J10): aggregate data on overall stock of UK CRE loans as at 31 December 2020
* Table B (in cells L4 to Y14): aggregate metrics for stock of UK CRE loans under £10 million
* Table C (in cells AA6 to AK8): aggregate data on UK CRE loan originated in 2020 and how much of these loan flows have
  been or are expected to be distributed out (through syndications or club deals).
* Table 1 (from row 17 down): loan-level data on the stock of UK CRE loans above £10 million. We have marked the level
  of prioritisation we attach to specific variables for this data collection. As such:

1. variables in red are very important and should be filled in with high-quality data,
1. variables in yellow are necessary and should be filled in on a best endeavours basis, and
1. variables in white are useful and should be provided if data is available.

Please ensure that you fill in the CRE total limits (table A) on the same basis / definition as the loan-level data on
the >£10m CRE loans (table 1), i.e. the difference between the total limit and the sum of the loan-level data should be
the sum of loans originated under £10m (table B). Data on exposures under £10m should be provided on a best endeavours
basis. Please note that the £10m threshold remains under review for future data collections.

# Tab #4 - Loan-level data - flows

Please also fill in the tab "Loan-level data - flows", if more than £300 million of UK CRE loans originated in 2020 have
been or are expected to be distributed. This is to understand the types of loans that are distributed out to other
lenders. Please include all loans originated in 2020, regardless of whether they have been distributed or kept on
balance sheet.

# Tab #5 - Additional Information

This tab requests additional pieces of information via free flow text, and via a table summarising key lending criteria.
Please keep responses brief wherever possible.

# Tab #6 - Drop Down Options

We have used drop down options wherever possible to keep answers comparable across respondents. We ask that you pick one
of drop down options where specified, as opposed to using free flow text.

| Weighted average remaining lease length | As is common practice from lenders, please make sure you insert the residual length of the lease rather (to expiry or break, whichever comes first) than the overall lease length. For example, for a 10-year lease contracted in 2018, the lease length which should be reported in the 2020 CRE underwriting standards review will be 8 years, alternatively for a 10 year lease contracted in 2018 but with a contractual break after 5 years, the lease length remaining should be 3 years. For special cases provide the following (unless more applicable information is known): residential assured shorthold tenancies: 12 months, student accommodation: 6 months, vacant properties or guarantees: 0 months. |
