# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Ideas for contribution
We encourage contributions to the platform on both the common_components and use_cases.
If you have particular domain expertise on any Regulatory Reporting use case, consider to 
implement it using an approach similar to what is demonstrated in the 
`use/cases/examples/home_loan_delinquency` use case.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
